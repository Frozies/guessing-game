# Here is a Java Guessing game built for COP 2006.


## To create a Guessing Game: In a Nutshell:

Determine and build documentation of:

Determine Initial Actors (use-cases)

Build alpha Procedural version of project

Turn-in: Basic version of number guessing game

Determine Object Structures (Classes) to be used in beta

Turn-in: Class UML

Build a command-line OOP beta version of program

Turn-in: OOP beta version of program

Add file handling for storage

Add nested structures, overrides, and overloads as needed (i.e. clean up)

test, test, test SHIP!

Turn-in: Final project with file "top scorers!"



## Phase 1

1. -[x]  plan project

2. -[x]  ensure artifacts due and due dates are known

3. -[x]  build plan for alpha program (first deliverable: Flowchart)



## Phase 2

1. -[x] Build procedural Alpha Version which:

2. -[x] Randomly generate a number between 1 and 15

3. -[x] Track each round's score (which starts at 10)

4. -[x] Track the player's total score

5. -[x] Take in input:

6. -[x] Player Name
(First/Last/MI but get full)
I.e. I would enter: "Josiah S Greenwell"
    

7. -[x] Player's DoB (get as MM/DD/YYYY) Store as 3 separate variables

8. -[x] Player's guess

9. -[x] Validate Player guess (should be between..)

10. -[x] Determine if Player guess is high/low/correct

11. -[x] If correct: output score

12. -[x] If incorrect:
Subtract 1 from score
Determine if score is 0
Return a "You lose" message with computer's number

13. -[x] If Score >0:
Determine if high/low and output correct message for these
If the Player did not lose: Ask Player if they want to play again and repeat game or exit based on answer
If new game: add round score to total
If exit or they lost: output total score

14. Turn-in: Alpha Version of Program

## Phase 3

1. -[ ] Add appropriate classes

2. -[ ] Single Responsibility Principle should be followed

3. -[ ] Ensure methods and properties are created and follow DRY Principle

4. -[ ] Turn-in: Class UML created for planning



## Final Phase

1. -[ ] Refactor Procedural Alpha Project to OOP Beta

2. -[ ] Add appropriate overrides, overloads, and nested collections

3. -[ ] Add file handling to record the top 5 high scores!

4. -[ ] And read/print them at start of the game.

5. -[ ] Turn-in: Beta Version of project
