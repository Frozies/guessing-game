#Here is a Java Guessing game built for COP 2006.


##To create a Guessing Game: In a Nutshell:

1. -[ ] Determine and build documentation of:

2. -[ ]  Determine Initial Actors (use-cases)

3. -[ ]  Build alpha Procedural version of project

4. -[ ]  Turn-in: Basic version of number guessing game

5. -[ ]  Determine Object Structures (Classes) to be used in beta

6. -[ ]  Turn-in: Class UML

7. -[ ]  Build a command-line OOP beta version of program

8. -[ ]  Turn-in: OOP beta version of program

9. -[ ]  Add file handling for storage

10. -[ ]  Add nested structures, overrides, and overloads as needed (i.e. clean up)

11. -[ ]  test, test, test SHIP!
Turn-in: Final project with file "top scorers!"



##Phase 1

1. -[ ]  plan project

2. -[ ]  ensure artifacts due and due dates are known

3. -[ ]  build plan for alpha program (first deliverable: Flowchart)



##Phase 2

1. -[ ] Build procedural Alpha Version which:

2. -[ ] Randomly generate a number between 1 and 15

3. -[ ] Track each round's score (which starts at 10)

4. -[ ] Track the player's total score

5. -[ ] Take in input:

6. -[ ] Player Name
(First/Last/MI but get full)
I.e. I would enter: "Josiah S Greenwell"

7. -[ ] Player's DoB (get as MM/DD/YYYY)

8. -[ ] Store as 3 separate variables

9. -[ ] Player's guess

10. -[ ] Validate Player guess (should be between..)

11. -[ ] Determine if Player guess is high/low/correct

12. -[ ] If correct: output score

13. -[ ] If incorrect:
Subtract 1 from score
Determine if score is 0
Return a "You lose" message with computer's number

14. -[ ] If Score >0:
Determine if high/low and output correct message for these
If the Player did not lose: Ask Player if they want to play again and repeat game or exit based on answer
If new game: add round score to total
If exit or they lost: output total score

15. Turn-in: Alpha Version of Program

##Phase 3

1. -[ ] Add appropriate classes

2. -[ ] Single Responsibility Principle should be followed

3. -[ ] Ensure methods and properties are created and follow DRY Principle

4. -[ ] Turn-in: Class UML created for planning



##Final Phase

1. -[ ] Refactor Procedural Alpha Project to OOP Beta

2. -[ ] Add appropriate overrides, overloads, and nested collections

3. -[ ] Add file handling to record the top 5 high scores!

4. -[ ] And read/print them at start of the game.

5. -[ ] Turn-in: Beta Version of project
